# What is this even about?
_"You truly aren't a complete Linux user if you don't know how to write a kernel module for it."_ - said probably no one.

As a challenge to myself to learn new libraries, I am teaching myself how to write a kernel module in C. 

# Installation?
I am currently testing this project both on an Arch virtual machine running on Qemu and on a Debian machine running on bare metal. 

To install, you'd need:
- `gcc`
- `make`
- `arch/debian`
